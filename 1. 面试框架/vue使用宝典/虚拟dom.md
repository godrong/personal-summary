为什么需要 vm virtual dom?
 1. First, it is also the original purpose of virtual DOM, for a better cross-platform, If you want to implement SSR (server rendering), then a way is to use Virtual Dom because the Virtual Dom itself is a JavaScript object.
 2.  Secondly,  we all know that the secret in front-end performance optimization is to operate as little as possible.not only DOM relatively show,but more because frequent change DOM will cause the browser to return or redraw, these are the performance of the killer.Therefore, we need this layer of abstraction, which will update the difference into the DOM during the PATCH, so that the DOM does not have a poor performance.
 3.  Finally, a basic requirement of the modern front-end framework is that there is no need to manually operate the DOM. On the one hand, it is because the manual operation of the DOM cannot guarantee the program performance, and if the code review is not strict, it may have a lower performance of developers.The code, on the other hand, more importantly, omitting the manual DOM operation can greatly increase the development efficiency.
